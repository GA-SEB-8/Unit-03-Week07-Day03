## Version 1.1 - December 28, 2024

### Release details

This release updates lecture code to use Vite version 6, and React version 19.

#### Additions

None.

#### Changes

- Update lecture code to use Vite version 6.
- Update lecture code to use React version 19.
- Update to use internal template version 2.
- Various code/lecture updates to improve readability and delivery. For example, `petList` state was renamed to `pets` so that it doesn't use the same name as the `PetList` component. Code in the lecture should also be more consistent with other React content.
- Moved the environment variable setup out of the **Setup** microlesson into its own microlesson (**Environment Variables in Vite**) since this is the first time students see it used making it more fitting as lecture material instead of setup.
- Split the **Create** microlesson into two separate microlessons: **Build the Create Form** and **Create and Display a New Pet**.

#### Removals

None.
