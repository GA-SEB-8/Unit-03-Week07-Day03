## About

Welcome to Reactville, a constantly evolving virtual metropolis. Let's build this digital town together, one component at a time.

The Reactville Animal Shelter is seeking a solution to keep track of all the animals currently available for adoption. You will help them build an interactive dashboard where shelter staff can add, update, and remove animals throughout the adoption process. Let's help these pets find their fur-ever home!

By the end of this lab, students will have a front end that consumes a RESTful API, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete data. This lesson is a basic introduction to consuming APIs with React and **does not** include React Router to change views; instead, students will use conditional rendering to display different components in a dashboard layout.
