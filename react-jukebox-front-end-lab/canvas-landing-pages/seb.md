## About

Welcome to Reactville, a constantly evolving virtual metropolis. Let's build this digital town together, one component at a time.

![Reactville Banner](../assets/reactville.png)

The community center of Reactville is launching an exciting projectâ€”a public jukebox! Your task is to help them build an interactive user interface where everyone can collaborate to manage the track library. Users will be able to add, update, and remove tracks, creating a dynamic playlist that all residents can enjoy at town events!

By the end of this lab, students will have developed a frontend that interacts with a RESTful API, enabling users to perform create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations on track data. This lab provides a practical application for consuming an API with React.

> ðŸš¨ This module requires an existing API to perform CRUD operations on a music `track` resource.
