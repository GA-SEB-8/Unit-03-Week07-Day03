## About

In this module, you'll learn how to fetch data from an API and display it in a React application. They will learn how to use the `fetch` API to make requests to a server and how to handle the response. They will also learn how to use `useEffect()` to fetch data when a component mounts and how to use `useState()` to store the data in the component's state.
