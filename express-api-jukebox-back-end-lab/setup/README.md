## Setup

Open your Terminal application and navigate to your `~/code/ga/labs` directory:

```bash
cd ~/code/ga/labs
```

Make a new repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/) named `express-api-jukebox-back-end-lab`.

Clone a copy of your remote repo locally by using the `git clone` command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/express-api-jukebox-back-end-lab.git
```

> ðŸš¨ Do not copy the above command. It will not work. Your GitHub username will replace `<your-username>` (including the `<` and `>`) in the URL above.

Next, `cd` into your new cloned directory, `express-api-jukebox-back-end-lab`:

```bash
cd express-api-jukebox-back-end-lab
```

Open the project's folder in your code editor:

```bash
code .
```
